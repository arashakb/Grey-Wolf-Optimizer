# Grey-Wolf-Optimizer

Welcome to the Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) implementation repository! This repository contains a Python implementation of the Grey Wolf Optimizer algorithm, a nature-inspired optimization technique that simulates the collaborative hunting behavior of grey wolves to solve optimization problems. The implementation provided here showcases the core concepts of the GWO algorithm and offers a starting point for experimentation and further development.
Overview

The Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) algorithm is a heuristic optimization technique inspired by the social structure and hunting dynamics of grey wolf packs. This algorithm involves a hierarchical structure where wolves (potential solutions) emulate the alpha, beta, and delta wolves within the pack. By iteratively updating their positions, the wolves collectively converge towards optimal solutions in the search space.
### Implementation Details

The implementation is provided as a Python class named GreyWolfOptimizer, encapsulating the key functionalities of the GWO algorithm.
The optimize method of the class demonstrates the optimization process, including initializing the hierarchy of wolves and iteratively updating their positions.
The algorithm aims to minimize a user-defined target function, which should be provided to the class during instantiation.
The implementation utilizes randomization, position updates, and adaptation of the linear component to explore the solution space effectively.

### Getting Started

- Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
- Open the grey_wolf_optimizer.py file in your preferred Python environment.
- Modify the target_function to match your optimization problem.
- Adjust parameters such as pack_size, min_values, max_values, and iterations as needed.
- Run the script to observe the optimization process and the best solution found.

### Usage and Customization

The GreyWolfOptimizer class provides methods for initializing the hierarchy, updating positions, and conducting optimization iterations.
You can modify the initialization process, position updates, or other components to experiment with variations of the GWO algorithm.
Incorporate your own optimization problems by defining the target_function to suit your specific use case.
